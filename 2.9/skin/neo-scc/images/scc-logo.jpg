<span style="color: rgb(51, 153, 102); "><b>Sakai will be upgraded to version 2.9 today, Monday, May 27</b></span>. This upgrade will include a major overhaul of the user interface as well as many improvements and additions to tools within the system.<br>
<br>
Because of the size of the upgrade, <span style="color: rgb(51, 153, 102); "><b>Sakai will be unavailable for much of the day</b></span><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 0);">.</span> &nbsp;Please plan accordingly! All course materials will be safely upgraded. &nbsp;The only thing you'll notice are a lot of new features that are available after the upgrade.<br>
<br>
Talk to your local institution's coordinator if you have questions about timing or new features that will included in this significant upgrade.<br></div>
